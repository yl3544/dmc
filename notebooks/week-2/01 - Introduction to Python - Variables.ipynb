    "Python can now be found not only in software development applications, but also embedded as a scripting language within many other types of software, including GIS software such as ArcGIS and QGIS, and design software such as Rhino. So if you are not a programmer but want to learn one programming language that will provide you the most use no matter what your career, there is a strong argument that the language should be Python. Before we start using Python for developing Machine Learning applications, we will first get familiar with it by going over some of the very general concepts of computer programming."

    "Python is not a piece of software like the type you typically use, but a programming language. Therefore, you do not install and run it in the same way as a typical program. Instead, you install a series of libraries that will exist somewhere on your computer, and will allow you to write and interpret code in the language. There are many ways to use Python. The most straight forward way is to run Python directly from your command terminal. This is how most programmers develop code, but it can be less intuitive if you're not used to a text-only environment. There are also softwares available called [Itegrated Development Environments](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments) (or IDE's) which bundle a Python interpreter with a typical text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will use a third option called [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter allows you to develop Python code in an interactive environment directly within a web browser. It has many graphic and interactive features which make developing and sharing code easier. At the same time the files it generates are still text-based and thus can be used with a version tracking system such as Github. All programming work for this class including demos, tutorials, and assignments will be contained within Jupyter notebooks such as the one you're looking at right now. "

    "# Basic elements of computer programming\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never written code, or done any computer programming, the whole concept might seem daunting at first. In fact, while advanced software development is without a doubt incredibly complex, programming in general is based on only a few key concepts. If you compare a computer language to a human language, the particular syntax or terms of the language might be related to the proper spelling of words, while the larger concepts are related to the general grammar. By understanding these concepts from the beginning, you will be less intimidated by all of the particular syntax that you do not know. As long as you can express what you want the program to do in general terms, you can always search the internet for examples on using the proper syntax. In fact this is how most people learn to code today. Furthermore, while each programming language (of which there are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)) has it's own syntax, they almost all follow the same basic principles. So learning these principles will be useful no matter what language you end up using, as we will see when we start to use some JavaScript later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In separating the basic principles and structure of code from the syntax of a particular language, one useful concept is [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). Pseudocode is the description of a program's basic functionality through natural language, which is translated later to actual syntax. Using pseudocode can be useful when you are first learning a language because it lets you describe features of a program that you do not yet know how to execute. It is also used by experienced programmers to describe a program's rough template or outline, which is then fleshed out by one or more developers in actual code. Pseudocode is often even left in the final code as comments, to provide a quick reference to the code's structure as a reminder to the developer, or to someone who is not as familiar with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we come to our first bit of Python syntax, the all-important 'comment'. You specify a comment by starting a line with '#', which tells Python to ignore everything on that line *after* the '#' symbol. Try typing the following lines code into a new file and executing it with Python:"

    "In Python, you can name your variables anything, as long as it starts with a letter, does not contain spaces, and is not a reserved keyword (such as 'print'). In practice, to enhance readability most programmers follow some conventions for naming variables. One common approach is to use 'camel case' to make variables composed of multiple words readable without spaces.\n",

    "withCamelCaseTheFirstWordIsLowerCaseWhileAllSubsequentWordsAreUpperCase\n",

    "It is also common to substitute underscores ('_') for spaces in variable names. In general, variable names should not be too long, but should err on the side of description rather than brevity to facilitate the code's readability. For instance, if you are keeping track of the number of blueberries, it is better to call the variable 'numBlueberries' than simply 'n' or 'b'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can hold data of different types. Although Python does not make you explicitly declare the type of data you will be using, it is important to know the types because they will each behave differently in your code.
